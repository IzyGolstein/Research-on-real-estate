# Actual hypothesis

1. It's easy to note that today's real estate market is not balanced due to price sharp price difference between flats available for buying in preferential mortgage and without this availability. The point is that price difference also includes huge amount of factors that affect price, that's why it's hard for us to extract only mortgage factor. We have a solution draft: there are flats in the non-fineshed house that are selling without preferential mortgage and we will build model that's will separate effects of all advantages of new building from simple availibility of chip loan.

$\textbf{In simple terms}$ we will get list of new buildings with the smallest premium in price for preferential mortgage.

3. We always want to buy something chip enough and good enough at the same time. There is a hypothesis that we can fit model on actuoal flat offers and then put our eyes on flats that's price is less than predicted. As result we will get underestimated flats what is good for buying. On the other hand we simply can get flats with incorrect predict)
